  <h1>Life Poems</h1>
  <p>What does it mean to write a poem about life? Is it Ginsberg's Howl when he tears down all the lives the people around him live? Is it the entirety of Thoreux's Walden when he tell us to "live deliberately"? Or are the best poems about life the ones that show us how we are living, and how we could live, if all we did was breathe in and out and accept life as it is given? This section of poems are the ones learnt in grade school, which no grade school child could understand until they grew older and found that these poems laid a foundation of empathy, learning, and passion. </p>

      <h3>William Ernest Henley's Invictus</h3>
      <p>Out of the night that covers me,
 <br>     Black as the pit from pole to pole,
<br>I thank whatever gods may be
      <br>For my unconquerable soul.
<br><br>
<br>In the fell clutch of circumstance
     <br> I have not winced nor cried aloud.
<br>Under the bludgeonings of chance
      <br>My head is bloody, but unbowed.
<br><br>
<br>Beyond this place of wrath and tears
      <br>Looms but the Horror of the shade,
<br>And yet the menace of the years
      <br>Finds and shall find me unafraid.
<br><br>
<br>It matters not how strait the gate,
      <br>How charged with punishments the scroll,
<br>I am the master of my fate,
      <br>I am the captain of my soul.</p>

      <h3>Phillip Larkin's This Be the Verse</h3>
      <p>They fuck you up, your mum and dad.   
<br>    They may not mean to, but they do.   
<br>They fill you with the faults they had
<br>    And add some extra, just for you.
<br><br>
<br>But they were fucked up in their turn
<br>   By fools in old-style hats and coats,   
<br>Who half the time were soppy-stern
<br>    And half at one another’s throats.
<br><br>
<br>Man hands on misery to man.
<br>    It deepens like a coastal shelf.
<br>Get out as early as you can,
<br>   And don’t have any kids yourself.</p>

      <h3>Robert Frost's Acquainted with the Night</h3>        
      <p>I have been one acquainted with the night.
<br>I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.
<br>I have outwalked the furthest city light.
<br><br>
<br>I have looked down the saddest city lane.
<br>I have passed by the watchman on his beat
<br>And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.
<br><br>
<br>I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
<br>When far away an interrupted cry
<br>Came over houses from another street,
<br><br>
<br>But not to call me back or say good-bye;
<br>And further still at an unearthly height,
<br>One luminary clock against the sky
<br><br>
<br>Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right. 
<br>I have been one acquainted with the night.</p>
