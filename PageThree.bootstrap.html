      <h3>William Shakespeare's Sonnet 130</h3>
      <p>My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun;
<br>Coral is far more red than her lips’ red;
<br>If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
<br>If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
<br>I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
<br>But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
<br>And in some perfumes is there more delight
<br>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
<br>I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
<br>That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
<br>I grant I never saw a goddess go;
<br>My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
<br>     And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
<br>     As any she belied with false compare.</p>

      <h3>Lewis Carroll's Walrus and the Carpenter</h3>
      <p>The sun was shining on the sea,
<br>Shining with all his might:
<br>He did his very best to make
<br>The billows smooth and bright--
<br>And this was odd, because it was
<br>The middle of the night.
<br><br>
<br>The moon was shining sulkily,
<br>Because she thought the sun
<br>Had got no business to be there
<br>After the day was done--
<br>"It's very rude of him," she said,
<br>"To come and spoil the fun!"
<br><br>
<br>The sea was wet as wet could be,
<br>The sands were dry as dry.
<br>You could not see a cloud, because
<br>No cloud was in the sky:
<br>No birds were flying overhead--
<br>There were no birds to fly.
<br><br>
<br>The Walrus and the Carpenter
<br>Were walking close at hand;
<br>They wept like anything to see
<br>Such quantities of sand:
<br>"If this were only cleared away,"
<br>They said, "it would be grand!"
<br><br>
<br>"If seven maids with seven mops
<br>Swept it for half a year.
<br>Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
<br>"That they could get it clear?"
<br>"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
<br>And shed a bitter tear.
<br><br>
<br>"O Oysters, come and walk with us!"
<br>The Walrus did beseech.
<br>"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
<br>Along the briny beach:
<br>We cannot do with more than four,
<br>To give a hand to each."
<br><br>
<br>The eldest Oyster looked at him,
<br>But never a word he said:
<br>The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
<br>And shook his heavy head--
<br>Meaning to say he did not choose
<br>To leave the oyster-bed.
<br><br>
<br>But four young Oysters hurried up,
<br>All eager for the treat:
<br>Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
<br>Their shoes were clean and neat--
<br>And this was odd, because, you know,
<br>They hadn't any feet.
<br><br>
<br>Four other Oysters followed them,
<br>And yet another four;
<br>And thick and fast they came at last,
<br>And more, and more, and more--
<br>All hopping through the frothy waves,
<br>And scrambling to the shore.
<br><br>
<br>The Walrus and the Carpenter
<br>Walked on a mile or so,
<br>And then they rested on a rock
<br>Conveniently low:
<br>And all the little Oysters stood
<br>And waited in a row.
<br><br>
<br>"The time has come," the Walrus said,
<br>"To talk of many things:
<br>Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
<br>Of cabbages--and kings--
<br>And why the sea is boiling hot--
<br>And whether pigs have wings."
<br>
<br>"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
<br>"Before we have our chat;
<br>For some of us are out of breath,
<br>And all of us are fat!"
<br>"No hurry!" said the Carpenter.
<br>They thanked him much for that.
<br><br>
<br>"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
<br>"Is what we chiefly need:
<br>Pepper and vinegar besides
<br>Are very good indeed--
<br>Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,
<br>We can begin to feed."
<br><br>
<br>"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
<br>Turning a little blue.
<br>"After such kindness, that would be
<br>A dismal thing to do!"
<br>"The night is fine," the Walrus said.
<br>"Do you admire the view?
<br><br>
<br>"It was so kind of you to come!
<br>And you are very nice!"
<br>The Carpenter said nothing but
<br>"Cut us another slice:
<br>I wish you were not quite so deaf--
<br>I've had to ask you twice!"
<br><br>
<br>"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
<br>"To play them such a trick,
<br>After we've brought them out so far,
<br>And made them trot so quick!"
<br>The Carpenter said nothing but
<br>"The butter's spread too thick!"
<br><br>
<br>"I weep for you," the Walrus said:
<br>"I deeply sympathize."
<br>With sobs and tears he sorted out
<br>Those of the largest size,
<br>Holding his pocket-handkerchief
<br>Before his streaming eyes.
<br><br>
<br>"O Oysters," said the Carpenter,
<br>"You've had a pleasant run!
<br>Shall we be trotting home again?'
<br>But answer came there none--
<br>And this was scarcely odd, because
<br>They'd eaten every one</p>

      <h3>Wendy Cope's Difference of Opinion</h3>        
      <p>He tells her that the earth is flat--
<br>He knows the facts, and that is that.
<br>In altercations fierce and long
<br>She tries her best to prove him wrong.
<br>But he has learned to argue well.
<br>He calls her arguments unsound
<br>And often asks her not to yell.
<br>She cannot win. He stands his ground.
