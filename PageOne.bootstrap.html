      <h3>William Shakespeare's Sonnet(to Memorize)</h3>
      <p>When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,
<br>I all alone beweep my outcast state,
<br>And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
<br>And look upon myself and curse my fate,
<br>Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
<br>Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
<br>Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,
<br>With what I most enjoy contented least;
<br>Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
<br>Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
<br>(Like to the lark at break of day arising
<br>From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate;
<br><br>       For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
<br><br>       That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</p>
    </div>
	
<div class="col-sm-4">
	  <h3>Pablo Neruda's Sonnet(to Memorize):</h3>
	  <p>I don’t love you as if you were a rose of salt, topaz,   
<br>or arrow of carnations that propagate fire:   
<br>I love you as one loves certain obscure things,   
<br>secretly, between the shadow and the soul.
<br><br>
<br>I love you as the plant that doesn’t bloom but carries   
<br>the light of those flowers, hidden, within itself,   
<br>and thanks to your love the tight aroma that arose   
<br>from the earth lives dimly in my body.
<br><br>
<br>I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where,   
<br>I love you directly without problems or pride:
<br>I love you like this because I don’t know any other way to love,
<br>except in this form in which I am not nor are you,   
<br>so close that your hand upon my chest is mine,   
<br>so close that your eyes close with my dreams.</p>

<div class="col-sm-4">
	  <h3>Alfred Tennyson's In Memoriam Section 50(to Memorize):</h3>
	  <p>Be near me when my light is low,
  <br>When the blood creeps, and the nerves prick
  <br>And tingle; and the heart is sick,
<br>And all the wheels of Being slow.
<br><br>
<br>Be near me when the sensuous frame
  <br>Is rack'd with pangs that conquer trust;
  <br>And Time, a maniac scattering dust,
<br>And Life, a Fury slinging flame.
<br><br>
<br>Be near me when my faith is dry,
   <br>And men the flies of latter spring,
   <br>That lay their eggs, and sting and sing
<br>And weave their petty cells and die.
<br><br>
<br>Be near me when I fade away,
   <br>To point the term of human strife,
   <br>And on the low dark verge of life
<br>The twilight of eternal day.</p>
